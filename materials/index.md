# ECS 154B Materials

You will find all of the lecture videos, quizzes, and extra information here.

For more information on the class, see [the syllabus](../syllabus/syllabus.md).

The class is broken into four main components: [Introduction to Computer Architecture](intro/index.md), [Processor Architecture](processor/index.md), [Memory Architecture](memory/index.md), and [Parallel Architecture](parallel/index.md).

All lecture videos will be available on [Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/courses/461400/external_tools/5280) or on [Aggie Video](https://video.ucdavis.edu/playlist/dedicated/0_8bwr1nkj/).
The following links provide context and supplemental information for these videos.
You are responsible for the information in both the videos and found in these pages.

The information here is subject to change, especially the parts later in the quarter.

## Detailed Class Outline

The class will generally be broken up into three parts, with more emphasis on the first section than the other two.
Each section will begin with the motivation for why you should care about this architectural component based on the performance or other metrics of the system.
Then, after going through the design details, we will summarize with specific example from modern systems.

Each section will have one or two project-based assignments (e.g., with the [DINO CPU](https://github.com/jlpteaching/dinocpu)) and end with an exam.

### [Introduction to Computer Architecture](intro/index.md) (One week)

In the first section of the class we will cover some motivation for why you should care about computer architecture and general computer architecture principles.

* [Introduction to the class](intro/intro.md)
* [Security and computer architecture](intro/security.md)
* [Current Computing Technology](intro/technology.md)
* [Computer System Evaluation](intro/evaluation.md)

### [Processor Architecture](processor/index.md) (Four weeks)

* [Instruction set architectures and RISC-V](processor/isa.md)
* [Single cycle CPU design](processor/single-cycle.md)
* [Pipelined CPU design](processor/pipelined.md)
* [Instruction-level parallelism](processor/ilp.md)
* [Processor architecture summary](processor/summary.md)

### [Memory System Architecture](memory/index.md) (Three weeks)

* [Why memory matters](memory/performance.md)
* [Memory technology](memory/technology.md)
* [Caches and memory hierarchy](memory/caches.md)
* [Virtual memory](memory/virtual.md)
* [Memory architecture summary](memory/summary.md)

### [Parallel Architectures](parallel/index.md) (Two weeks)

* [Parallel systems' performance](parallel/performance.md)
* [Parallel architectures and programming](parallel/architectures.md)
* [Parallel memory systems](parallel/memory.md)
* [GPUs and accelerators](parallel/accelerators.md)
