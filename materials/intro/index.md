# Introduction to Computer Architecture

Welcome to ECS 154B: Computer Architecture!

This first module [briefly introduces the class](./intro.md), motivates computer architecture with some [recent security vulnerabilities](./security.md), discusses the [current state of technology](./technology.md) in this field, and discusses how to [evaluate computer systems](./evaluation.md).
