## Turing Lecture **VIDEO**

Before diving into anything, I'd like you to take about an hour to watch the Turing Lecture given by John Hennessy and David Patterson.
The [Turing Award](https://amturing.acm.org/) is the "Nobel Prize of Computer Science."
It's given once a year "for major contributions of lasting importance to computing."

In 2017, the Turing Award was given to two computer architects, John Hennessy and David Patterson (who happened to write your book as well!).
They gave a lecture with the International Symposium on Computer Architecture or ISCA the premiere venue for computer architecture research.
Given that their audience was computer architecture researchers, I don't expect you to understand everything in the lecture.
However, it's great overview of the past, present, and future of the field of computer architecture.
We will come back again and again to the themes presented in this lecture.

## Moore's Law and Dennard scaling **VIDEO**

This video discusses Moore's Law and the driver of Moore's Law, Dennard Scaling.

If you are interested, you can read the [original paper by Moore](https://newsroom.intel.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/moores-law-electronics.pdf) from 1965.
It's a quick read, and it's interesting to see what a visionary was thinking about back in the 60's!

On the opposite end, there's a good [New Your Times article about the end of Moore's Law](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/01/science/01chips.html) (subscription or campus VPN required) based on the paper ["Dark Silicon and the End of Multicore Scaling"](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hadi/doc/paper/2011-isca-dark_silicon.pdf) by Hadi Esmaeilzadeh, Emily Blem, Ren√©e St. Amant, Karthikeyan (Karu) Sankaralingam, and Doug Burger.

Now that we've discussed Moore's Law and Dennard Scaling, I want to call your attention to a specific part of the Turing Lecture when Hennessy talks about what happens now that Moore's Law is dead.
