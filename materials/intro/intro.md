First of all, welcome!

Welcome to the online-only version of UC Davis ECS 154B Computer Architecture in Spring Quarter 2020!
This is going to be a *unique* experience as we all try to figure out how to best interact in an online-only format.

My goal with this class is to encourage as much participation and interaction as possible.
I learn best from interacting with others.
So, I'm going to provide you with as many ways to interact with me, with our TA (Julian), and each other as possible.

## What is this class?

Here, we find our first video.
Throughout these materials, there will be embedded videos for you to watch.
These will be taking the place of in-person lecture.

This video welcomes you to the class!
(note: This is a test right now.)

Usually, these videos will be 5-15 minutes long so that you won't be overwhelmed.
After each video, there will be a short Canvas-based quiz to check your understanding.
There is more information about quizzes [below](#quizzes).

### Quiz 0: A little about yourself

[Use xxxx to complete the quiz.]()

## Class organization

As previously mentioned, this class will be all online.
For details of the class policies, see the [syllabus](../syllabus/syllabus.md).
Below, I'll briefly discuss some of the changes from a normal "in-person" class.

### Lectures

### Quizzes

There will be a short quiz after each video to help promote learning through this asynchronous medium.
You can take these quizzes as many times as you like.
The quizzes are due every couple of days, kind of like a normal lecture.
However, the late penalty for quizzes will be low, so if something comes up, you can take the quiz after you have found time to watch the video.

### Discussion

Not only will I be presenting lectures asynchronously through video, but discussions will also be online.
We will be using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) for discussion groups.

### Project

Throughout this class you will be designing the *Davis In-Order* CPU or [DINO CPU]().
The DINO

### Tests

### Books

**IMPORTANT:** The textbook on Canvas/vitalsource is *opt out*.
Thus, if you don't want to be charged for the textbook you must *opt out* by 4/16/2020!
